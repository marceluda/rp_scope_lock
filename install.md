# Install App in RedPitaya

First, you need an already running RedPitaya enviroment. If you don't know
how to prepare the device SDCard, just follow the
[RedPitaya help page instructions](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickStart/SDcard/SDcard.html)

To install the web application you need to upload the `scope+lock` folder
to `/opt/redpitaya/www/apps/`. You can do that with several SSH clients.
