Scope+Lock is an application for the [RedPitaya](https://redpitaya.com/) enviroment/board
that implements an Oscilloscope aplication and a Lock-in amplifier. It's based on
[relese-0.95 scope application](https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya/tree/release-v0.95/apps-free/scope)
of the RedPitaya project.

The aim of this application is to provide a toolkit for labs measurements and control applications.

## Features

- Web control interface
- Python based remote control (designed for Spyder under Linux)
- Complete Free Software source code.
- Oscilloscope application
- Lock-in amplifier (only with local oscillator)
- Modulation generator
  - Harmonic functions (from 3 Hz to 50 kHz)
    - Two 1f functions in quadrature (sine and cosine)
    - One 1f function with phase control
    - One 2f function  with phase control
    - One 3f function  with phase control
  - Square functions (from 30 mHz to 31 MHz)
    - Two 1f functions in quadrature
    - One 1f function with phase control
- Scan control
  - Triangle scan generator
  - Auto-lock / relock system
- Two configurable PID filters
  - Proportional, Integral and Derivative controllers
  - Set-point control
  - Several order of magnitudes
- Lock controller
  - System for making closed-loop stabilization schemes
  - Graphic tool for lock start-point selection

## Applications

The application implements a lock-in amplifier and two PID filters. This elements
are suitable for several stabilization schemes implementations: they measure
low amplitude signals to get a physical system state and then use a closed-loop feedback system to stabilize the state of the physical system to a desired one.

We call these
locking-systems o stabilization-systems. The actually probed schemes are mostly from laser-optics applications, because scope+lock was created in an optics lab with this purpose. But all off then are ready to use in any physical system o engineering project
controlled by electric signals.

### Applications Scope+lock

**Phase sensitive measurement of small signals**

>  Implementation of the lock-in technique to measure the response of a system
>  under and oscillatory excitation. If you use an excitation signal of frequency *f*
>  (reference signal),
>  the system response will have also a *f* Fourier component. With the lock-in technique
>  you can filter the *f* component and measure its amplitude and phase relation with
>  the reference signal. The filtering process enables you to reduce the noise signal from
>  the other frequencies components and amplify the response one, enhancing the
>  signal-to-noise ratio. We call this process *demodulation*. Also, you can demodulate
>  the input signal using *2f* and *3f* frequencies to get harmonic components that
>  have information of non-linear behavior of the physical system.


**Closed loop system schemes for variable stabilization**

>   You have a physical variable that you want to stabilize against environment changes.
>   You can measure it and convert it in an electrical signal you take from RP input 1.
>   With scope+lock you can stabilize it to a desired offset voltage value using an *error*
>   signal ( $error = input1 - offset$ ) that feeds a PID filter. The PID output is a
>   *correction* signals that can be added to the *control* signal that actually
>   controls the physical system.
>
>   This is called a close loop scheme. If it is well designed, you can use it to make
>   the physical system to be *"tied"* to a particular state.


**Combined systems**

>   Some times you can only measure the physical system that you want to stabilize
>   using information get by the lock-in technique. You can combine both techniques
>   to stabilize, for example, the phase of a system, the derivative of the response
>   signal or the noise-filtered amplitude of te response signal, building a lock-in
>   scheme whose output will be used as the *error* signal PID input.


###  Applications tested in lab
  - Stabilization of laser wavelength to atomic transition
  - Stabilization of laser wavelength to Fabry-Perot interferometer (Pound-Drever-Hall)
  - Stabilization of VCO frequency to an electronic reference (Crystal or RCL circuit)
